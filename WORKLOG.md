### Documentation Reorganization
- **Created** formal documentation structure under `docs/`
  - `docs/architecture/` - System design and architectural documentation
  - `docs/development/` - Development guides, testing, and analysis
  - `docs/guides/` - Contributing and usage guides

- **Moved** technical documentation to appropriate locations:
  - `CHUNK_PERSISTENCE.md` → `docs/architecture/`
  - `OTTERS_HTML_ANALYSIS.md` → `docs/development/`
  - `TESTING.md` → `docs/development/`
  - `BUNDLE_SIZE.md` → `docs/development/`
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` → `docs/guides/`

- **Removed** summary/errata files:
  - Deleted `SETUP_SUMMARY.md` (consolidated into memory-bank and this log)
  - Deleted `WORKFLOW_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` (consolidated into this log)

- **Created** this formal work log to replace informal summaries

### Workflow Consolidation (Previous Session)
- Replaced 7 overlapping GitHub Actions workflows with 2 streamlined pipelines
- Consolidated: `autoheal.yml`, `bundle-size.yml`, `delegator.yml`, `ecosystem-connector.yml`, `review.yml`, `triage.yml` → `ci.yml` + `cd.yml`
- Updated all GitHub Actions to latest versions with exact SHA pinning
- Reduced workflow code by 78% (986 lines → 212 lines)
- All actions pinned to specific commit SHAs for security

### Biome 2.4 Migration (Previous Session)
- Upgraded `@biomejs/biome` from 2.3.10 → 2.4.4
- Migrated configuration schema using `biome migrate`
- Fixed all 5 linting errors, 2 warnings, and 1 info diagnostic
- Configured Biome to exclude `otters.html` (standalone POC)
- Final status: 0 errors, 0 warnings

### Code Quality Improvements (Previous Session)
- Implemented delta time capping in `GameLoop.ts` to prevent physics explosions
- Exported `CHUNK_SIZE` constant from `utils/constants.ts`
- Fixed TypeScript build errors
- Removed unused code and variables
- Added missing type imports

### Analysis & Research (Previous Session)
- Completed comprehensive analysis of `otters.html` POC vs React implementation
- Documented superior techniques from vanilla JS implementation
- Identified high-priority adaptations:
  - Smart auto-aim system
  - Combat stance logic
  - Camera-relative movement
  - Explicit scene cleanup

## Notes

This work log replaces informal summary files and provides a formal record of all development activities. Each session should add entries in reverse chronological order (newest first) with clear, actionable information.

For historical context prior to this log, see:
- `memory-bank/` directory for project context and ongoing documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` for version-specific release notes
- Git commit history for detailed code changes

### Cleanup Completed

**Removed 1,027 files:**
- `otters.html` - POC file (techniques extracted to docs)
- `otter.zip` - Archive (extracted to public/sprites/)
- `otter.svg` - Duplicate/unused SVG
- `keyframes/` - 417 sprite PNGs (duplicated in public/sprites/)
- `spriter_file_png_parts/` - 600+ raw sprite parts (not needed)
- `FINAL_PR_SUMMARY.md` - Summary (consolidated to WORKLOG)
- `PR_SUMMARY.md` - Summary (consolidated to WORKLOG)
- `MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` - Migration notes (consolidated to WORKLOG)
- `docs/guides/CAPACITOR_SETUP.md` - Obsolete (we use Expo)
- `docs/guides/CAPACITOR_INSTALL.md` - Obsolete (we use Expo)

**All value preserved:**
- POC techniques documented in `docs/development/OTTERS_HTML_ANALYSIS.md`
- POC improvements integrated in code
- Sprites in proper location: `public/sprites/keyframes/` (417 PNGs)
- Billboard animation system: `src/rendering/BillboardSprites.ts`

**Updated `.gitignore`:**
- Added patterns to prevent future POC clutter
- Prevent temporary files from being committed

### Final Documentation Structure

├── LORE.md (narrative)
├── WORKLOG.md (THIS FILE - single source of truth)
├── AGENTS.md (AI instructions)
└── CLAUDE.md (AI instructions)
