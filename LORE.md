# 🦦 THE COPPER-SILT REACH: TECHNICAL BRIEFING

## 🌎 The Theater of War
**Name**: The Copper-Silt Reach
**Moniker**: "The Emerald Meat-Grinder"
**Atmosphere**: High-noon, 110-degree humidity. The sky is bleached Ektachrome white. The air tastes of burnt fuel and decaying mangroves.

## 🛡️ The Factions

### 1. United River Alliance (URA) - "The River-Rats"
A multi-specialist elite force of Mustelids (Otters) recalled from the northern territories. 
*   **Doctrine**: Tactical verticality, high-mobility, and superior fire-volume.
*   **Gear**: OD Green ballistic canvas, analog long-wave radios, and "Fish-Cannon" heavy ballistics.

### 2. The Scale-Guard Militia
A biological cult of apex crocodilians and reptilian predators.
*   **Doctrine**: Ambush, area-denial, and attrition.
*   **Tech**: Stolen URA webbing, heavy industrial siphons, and biological "Periscope" mimicry.
*   **Goal**: The "Sacred Sludge"—turning the river into a stagnant, oxygen-free bog where only scales can breathe.

## 🐚 The Objective: Liberation through Occupation
The URA isn't just here to raid; we are here to **CLAIM** the Reach. Every industrial siphon dismantled is a flag planted for the Alliance. 
*   **Secure & Hold**: Destroying a siphon "Secures" the local coordinate (chunk). 
*   **The Map**: Once secured, the terrain is fixed in Alliance records, and the "Sacred Sludge" smoke is replaced by the URA colors.
*   **Territory Score**: The Alliance high command tracks "Territory Secured." Reach high scores to unlock advanced platoon members and heavier ballistics.

## 🪖 Grunt Slang
*   **"The Soup"**: The water of the Reach.
*   **"Slick-Skin"**: Slur used by Gators for Otters.
*   **"Scale-Bait"**: New recruits.
*   **"Clam-Happy"**: A soldier who has spent too long in the Reach.
