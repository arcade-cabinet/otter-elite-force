# 🦦 THE COPPER-SILT REACH: TECHNICAL BRIEFING

## 🌎 The Theater of War
**Name**: The Copper-Silt Reach
**Moniker**: "The Emerald Meat-Grinder"
**Atmosphere**: High-noon, 110-degree humidity. The sky is bleached Ektachrome white. The air tastes of burnt fuel and decaying mangroves.

## 🛡️ The Factions

### 1. United River Alliance (URA) - "The Peacekeepers"
A multi-specialist elite force of Mustelids (Otters) recalled from the northern territories. 
*   **Doctrine**: Liberation through verticality. We occupy to restore peace.
*   **Goal**: Dismantle Scale-Guard siphons and return territory to the villagers.

### 3. The Mustelid Civilians - "The Villagers"
The original inhabitants of the Reach. They live in simple river hamlets and thatched huts.
*   **Status**: Under Scale-Guard occupation. They lack the ballistics to fight back but provide the URA with intel and credits once their hamlets are secured.
*   **Healers**: Rare, ancient villagers who still know the ways of the river. They can patch up a River-Rat's integrity in seconds if protected.

### 4. The Scale-Guard Militia
A biological cult of apex crocodilians and reptilian predators.
*   **Doctrine**: Ambush, area-denial, and attrition.
*   **Tech**: Stolen URA webbing, heavy industrial siphons, and biological "Periscope" mimicry.
*   **Goal**: The "Sacred Sludge"—turning the river into a stagnant, oxygen-free bog where only scales can breathe.

## 🐚 Strategic Objectives vs. Spoils of War

The URA differentiates between high-priority targets and the resources harvested from the Reach.

### 1. Strategic Objectives (The Mission)
These are critical to the occupation and peacekeeping effort. Dismantling these secures territory and earns massive XP.
*   **Industrial Siphons**: Large metal structures draining the ancestral clam beds. Dismantle them to secure the coordinate.
*   **Marsh Gas Stockpiles**: Hidden caches of volatile marsh gas used by the Militia. Capture them to cripple enemy logistics.
*   **Village Liberation**: Every hut secured return a coordinate to Alliance law.

### 2. Spoils of War (The Bonus)
These are resources used to fund the platoon's upgrades and equipment at the FOB.
*   **Clam Baskets**: Found in river hamlets. They may contain a high concentration of supply credits... or they could be **Booby Traps**.
*   **Enemy Intel**: Rescuing villagers provides valuable intel and credits.

## 🪖 Grunt Slang
*   **"The Soup"**: The water of the Reach.
*   **"Slick-Skin"**: Slur used by Gators for Otters.
*   **"Scale-Bait"**: New recruits.
*   **"Clam-Happy"**: A soldier who has spent too long in the Reach.
