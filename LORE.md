# 🦦 THE COPPER-SILT REACH: TECHNICAL BRIEFING

## 🌎 The Theater of War
**Name**: The Copper-Silt Reach
**Moniker**: "The Emerald Meat-Grinder"
**Atmosphere**: High-noon, 110-degree humidity. The sky is bleached Ektachrome white. The air tastes of burnt fuel and decaying mangroves.

## 🛡️ The Factions

### 1. United River Alliance (URA) - "The River-Rats"
A multi-specialist elite force of Mustelids (Otters) recalled from the northern territories. 
*   **Doctrine**: Tactical verticality, high-mobility, and superior fire-volume.
*   **Gear**: OD Green ballistic canvas, analog long-wave radios, and "Fish-Cannon" heavy ballistics.

### 2. The Scale-Guard Militia
A biological cult of apex crocodilians and reptilian predators.
*   **Doctrine**: Ambush, area-denial, and attrition.
*   **Tech**: Stolen URA webbing, heavy industrial siphons, and biological "Periscope" mimicry.
*   **Goal**: The "Sacred Sludge"—turning the river into a stagnant, oxygen-free bog where only scales can breathe.

## 🐚 The Objective: Ancestral Clam Beds
Not just fuel—these are the Reach's soul. The Scale-Guard is siphoning the beds to fund their expansion. The URA is here to dismantle the siphons, coordinate-by-coordinate.

## 🪖 Grunt Slang
*   **"The Soup"**: The water of the Reach.
*   **"Slick-Skin"**: Slur used by Gators for Otters.
*   **"Scale-Bait"**: New recruits.
*   **"Clam-Happy"**: A soldier who has spent too long in the Reach.
