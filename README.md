# OTTER: ELITE FORCE

> "Defend the River. Fear the Clam."

OTTER: ELITE FORCE is a single-file, procedurally generated tactical shooter that runs entirely in your browser. You play as Sgt. Bubbles, a battle-hardened otter deployed to the Mekong Delta to stop the mechanical "Iron Scale" dominion.

## 🎮 How to Play

### Mobile Controls (Touch)

- **Left Stick**: Move & Strafe.
  - Tip: If you aren't aiming, Bubbles sprints faster.
- **Right Stick**: Aim & Auto-Fire.
  - Combat Stance: Touching this stick locks Bubbles' facing direction to your aim for tactical strafing.
- **[SCOPE] Button**: Toggle Zoom for long-range engagements.
- **Tilt (Gyro)**: Fine-tune your aim by tilting your device (requires permission on iOS).

### Desktop Controls (Mouse)

- The game is optimized for Touch, but supports Mouse input for testing (Click & Drag simulation).

## 🌟 Features

- **Zero Dependencies**: The entire game is contained in one index.html file. No assets to download, no servers to run.
- **Procedural Engine**:
  - Assets: All 3D models (Otters, Choppers, Guns) are generated via code geometry.
  - Audio: Music and SFX are synthesized in real-time using the Web Audio API.
  - Levels: Enemy spawns and terrain decoration are randomized every run.
- **Persistent Campaign**:
  - Rank up from Pup to Admiral.
  - Unlock 4 distinct levels with varying weather and time-of-day conditions.
  - Save data persists via localStorage.
- **Atmospheric Rendering**:
  - Custom Vertex Shaders for Water and Flag animation.
  - Dynamic lighting with "God Rays" (volumetric fakes) and bloom-like contrast.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Engine**: Three.js (r160 via ES Modules).
- **Language**: TypeScript (ES6+).
- **Audio**: Native Web Audio API (Oscillators & Biquad Filters).
- **Storage**: HTML5 LocalStorage.
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Linting/Formatting**: Biome

## 📜 Lore

The United River Alliance (URA) has lived in peace for centuries. But now, the Iron Scale Dominion—a legion of cyborg alligators—has begun polluting the delta. They seek the Primal Clams, a power source hidden in the mud.

Sgt. Bubbles, a veteran of the Creek Wars, is the only otter capable of operating the Heavy 50-Caliber Fish-Cannon. He has been deployed solo to clear the sector.
