# 🤖 CLAUDE MISSION CONTROL: OTTER ELITE FORCE

## 🎯 Current Operational Goal
Transition from **Technical Demo** to **Tactical Simulation**. The foundation is built (Chunking, OTS Camera, MOS), now we must breathe life into the "Internal Organs" of the Copper-Silt Reach.

## 🪖 Tactical Verticals

### 1. Squad Intelligence (Priority: HIGH)
- **Problem**: Predators are individually smart but collectively dumb.
- **Solution**: Implement "Pack Logic" where Scale-Guard scouts signal heavy gators. Use Yuka's `EntityManager` to coordinate pincer maneuvers.

### 2. Environmental Hazards (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Objective**: The Reach should feel like an enemy.
- **Hazards**: 
  - **Oil Slicks**: High slip, flammability logic.
  - **Toxic Sludge**: Health drain in Scale-Guard territory.
  - **Monsoon Rain**: Visual haze, reduced muzzle velocity, reduced visibility.

### 3. Destruction & Explosives (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Mechanics**: Implement **Claymore Clams** and **Grenade Launchers**. 
- **Destructibility**: Allow modular hut components and wooden platforms to be splintered by high-damage impacts.

### 4. Rescue & Extraction (Priority: HIGH)
- **Loop**: Rescue Ally -> Escort to LZ -> New Specialist Unlocked.
- **Vertical**: Map characters like `GEN. WHISKERS` to specific high-threat chunks (e.g. 10, 10).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Bulwarks
- **Frontend**: React 19 + R3F + Drei
- **AI**: Yuka (FSM, Steering)
- **Audio**: Tone.js (Procedural Synth)
- **State**: Zustand (Persistent Save Data)
- **Quality**: Biome (Lint/Format), Vitest (Logic), Playwright (E2E)

## 🕵️ AI Self-Improvement Loops
When performing a loop, Claude must:
1. **Analyze Store Impact**: Does this mechanic need to save state?
2. **Verify Performance**: Test with high-density `InstancedMesh`.
3. **Audit Grit**: Does it look like *Full Metal Jacket* or *Tron*? Reject any sci-fi drift.
4. **Haptic Sync**: Ensure impacts trigger the vibration API where supported.

## 🗺️ Persistent Coordinates of Interest
- **(0, 0)**: Initial LZ / Base Site.
- **(5, 5)**: Scale-Guard Prison Camp (Prisoner Rescue).
- **(10, -10)**: The Great Siphon (Boss Encounter).
- **(-15, 20)**: Healer's Grove (Peacekeeping Hub).
