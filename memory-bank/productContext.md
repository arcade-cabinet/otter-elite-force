# Product Context: OTTER: ELITE FORCE

## Why This Project Exists

The goal is to create a uniquely portable, high-quality tactical game experience that demonstrates the power of purely procedural generation in modern web technologies. It provides an instant-play tactical simulator that feels like a full-scale open world game without traditional multi-gigabyte downloads.

## Core Design Philosophy

### "Vietnam but with Otters"
The aesthetic is **gritty riverine warfare** — not sci-fi, not fantasy, but analog military realism transported into the animal kingdom. Think:
- 1960s Mekong Delta in high-noon daylight
- The smell of napalm and marsh gas
- Harsh shadows, bleached skies, thick silt-brown water
- Canvas, mud, oil, and heavy metal — NOT chrome or lasers

### "Full Metal Jacket meets Wind in the Willows"
A unique tonal blend:
- **Tactical Weight**: Gear feels heavy, decisions have consequences
- **Whimsical Charm**: Otters with bandanas and tactical vests
- **Gritty Atmosphere**: War is hell, even for river mammals

## Problems It Solves

### Zero-Download Access
- Immediate gameplay in the browser with no installation or asset fetching
- Procedural generation means infinite content without download bloat

### Infinite Variety Without Randomness Fatigue
- **Fixed on Discovery**: Procedurally generated terrain becomes PERMANENT once explored
- Unlike roguelikes, returning to an area shows the same layout
- Creates a sense of ownership and familiarity with your territory

### Mobile-Web Input Conflicts
- Solves touch control issues by providing high-fidelity touch routing
- Separates UI interaction from gameplay movement
- No "ghost drags" or accidental button presses during combat

## User Experience Goals

### Main Menu as Command Center
The main menu is NOT just a "press start" screen — it's a **tactical command interface**:

1. **New Campaign**: Deploy fresh into the Copper-Silt Reach
2. **Continue Campaign**: Resume persistent open world from exact state
3. **Canteen (FOB Hub)**: 
   - View unlocked platoon members
   - Purchase permanent upgrades
   - Review map intel and objectives

### Open World Exploration
- **No Level Select**: One continuous world to explore
- **Territory Revealed**: Fog of war lifts as you explore
- **Persistent Changes**: Destroyed siphons stay destroyed, liberated villages stay free

### Victory Through Occupation
Three ways to "win" each session:

1. **Strategic Dominance**: Secure enough territory by destroying siphons
2. **Rescue Operations**: Find and extract all trapped platoon members
3. **Peacekeeping Victory**: Liberate a threshold of native villages

### Difficulty as Commitment
- You choose your difficulty at campaign start
- You can INCREASE difficulty mid-campaign but NEVER decrease
- Creates meaningful weight to the "go hardcore" decision

## Key Features

### Tactical Gameplay Loop
1. **Deploy** from your LZ (0, 0)
2. **Explore** the persistent open world
3. **Complete Objectives**: Destroy siphons, capture gas, rescue villagers
4. **Gather Resources**: Clam baskets, eliminated enemies = supply credits
5. **Extract or Push**: Return to LZ or venture deeper
6. **Build Base**: Expand your FOB with modular construction
7. **Requisition**: Spend credits at Canteen for permanent upgrades

### Platoon Management
- **Rescue to Unlock**: Find platoon members in the world, don't buy them
- **Character Traits**: Each specialist has unique physics (speed, HP, climbing ability)
- **Gear Customization**: Swap weapons and equipment via Canteen upgrades

### Environmental Hazards
- **Oil Slicks**: Flammable, slippery — shoot to ignite for area damage
- **Mud Pits**: Slow movement, clog weapons
- **Toxic Sludge**: Health drain in Scale-Guard territory
- **Monsoon Weather**: Reduced visibility, different gameplay feel

### Base Building
- **First Objective**: Secure and fortify your LZ
- **Modular Construction**: Stilts, platforms, walls, roofs — algorithmically connected
- **Defensive Structures**: Build watchtowers, barricades, medical stations
- **Resource Processing**: Store and process gathered materials

### Three-Faction Dynamics
1. **URA Peacekeepers (You)**: Liberation and occupation
2. **Scale-Guard Militia (Enemy)**: Industrial occupation and predator worship
3. **Native Inhabitants (Neutral)**: Caught in the crossfire, awaiting rescue

## Target Experience

The player should feel like:
- A grizzled special forces operative behind enemy lines
- Every expedition into the Reach is tense and meaningful
- Building their base creates a sense of ownership and progress
- Rescuing a platoon member feels like a major achievement
- Returning to previously explored territory feels familiar, not repetitive
- The difficulty choice actually matters and creates different playstyles
