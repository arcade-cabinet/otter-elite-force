# Product Context: OTTER: ELITE FORCE

## Why this project exists
The goal is to create a uniquely portable and high-quality game experience that demonstrates the power of purely procedural generation in modern web technologies. It provides an instant-play tactical simulator that feels like a full-scale game without the traditional mult-gigabyte download overhead.

## Problems it solves
- **Zero-Download Access**: Immediate gameplay in the browser with no installation or asset fetching.
- **Infinite Variety**: Replaces static, hand-crafted levels with an endless world that offers new challenges every session.
- **Input Conflict**: Solves mobile-web control issues by providing high-fidelity touch routing that separates UI interaction from gameplay movement.

## User Experience Goals
- **Atmospheric Immersion**: Gritty, humid riverine warfare atmosphere created through custom shaders and procedural audio.
- **Responsive Combat**: Tight movement physics and high-feedback gunplay (muzzle flashes, recoil, particle effects).
- **Strategic Progression**: A sense of growth through the "Canteen" meta-loop, where players requisition better specialists and gear using earned credits.

## Key Features
- **Tactical Loop**: Deploy -> Explore -> Objective Completion (Siphons/Gas) -> Civilian Rescue -> Extraction.
- **Platoon Management**: Unlock diverse specialists (Sgt. Bubbles, Gen. Whiskers, Cpl. Splash) with unique traits.
- **Environmental Hazard interaction**: Strategic use of the environment, such as igniting oil slicks to create area-of-effect damage.
